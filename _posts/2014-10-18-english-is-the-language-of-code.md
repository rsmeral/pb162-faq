I decided that any posts on this site will be written in English as of today.

I am hoping this decision will motivate you to write *your* code, comments and documentation in English.

In relation to this, there's one more thing I'd like to suggest. Just as much as it is crucial to read the works of great writers when you are learning to write, or to listen to great musicians when you are learning to play or compose music, *it is vital to read code of other programmers when you are trying to learn to code*.

I strongly suggest you take a look at code others have written (not necessarily your classmates, at this point, that would be asking for trouble :smiley:). There's thousands of open source projects available and readily browsable on the internet. I understand that for someone who is just starting out with Java, most real-world applications might seem too complex and hard to comprehend. That, however, should not be an obstacle in at least giving it a try.

To prove that I do indeed practice what I preach, you can take a look at any of my projects and contributions: [github.com/rsmeral](https://github.com/rsmeral). That being said, my code is surely not exemplary and contains bugs and mistakes here and there. But it is all documented in English, and mostly written in Java.

English is the language of code.
